### filetype:

This search operators restricts the results to items of a specific type. Entering **puppies filetype:jpg** will get you lots of puppy pictures

### intext/allintext:

Finds pages containing a specific string of text. For example, **Beatles breakup intext:Paul McCartney** finds pages containing Paul's name and the words Beatles, breakup, or both.

Similar to **intext**, search for specified terms in the title of webpages
